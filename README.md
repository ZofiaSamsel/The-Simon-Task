# Simon effect
The Simon effect states that people respond faster and more accurately if the stimulus and the response features (in this case: the side on which the button is located) coincide. This programme was written to conduct a test on this perceived effect.

# Procedure:
1. A fixation point (crosshairs) is displayed in the center of the screen.
2. Words ‘left’ or ‘right’ appear on either left or right side of the screen.
3. The subject has to press either Q buton (for lef) or P button (for right). The person's task is to press the key corresponding to the meaning of the word regardless of where it appears.

The program was written in Python (using PsychoPy library) and it collected result files for each participant.
