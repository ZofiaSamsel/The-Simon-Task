# The-Simon-Task
Procedure created for the Simon task experiment.  

# Simon effect
The Simon effect states that people respond faster and more accurately if the stimulus and the response features (e.g. the side on which the button is located) coincide.

# Procedure:
1. A fixation point (crosshairs) is displayed in the center of the screen.
2. One of the two words "left" or "right" on the left or right side appears on the screen.
3. The subject has to press one of the keys, e.g. Q (for left) and P (for right). The person's task is to press the key corresponding to the meaning of the word regardless of where it appears.

The program is written in Python.
